<h3>New Boston Promotions<br>
Your Source For Imprinted Promotional Products</h3>
<p>
<br>
New Boston Promotions was founded by Mary Melodee Mena in 1988 to provide 
promotional products for clients of all sizes.  
Mary will help you use promotional products to deliver your message
to your target audience without waste.  Our products motivate, promote,
reward and reinforce your message&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;and they are desired and appreciated
when received.  Most of all, your message is kept and remembered 
&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;unlike traditional advertising.

<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>
In 1988 New Boston Promotions began as a small promotional products 
distributorship. In 1992 we formed a strategic alliance with Geiger, the 
largest family-owned and managed company in the promotional products 
industry. The combination of the two provides our clients with the 
flexibility, creativity and personal service of a small distributorship 
coupled with the competitive pricing, stability and technical know-how 
of an industry giant.  Geiger is a fourth-generation company, with 500 
full-time employees and in 2006 it reported revenues of over 146 million 
dollars.
</p>

<p>
The past 20 years have been exciting ones for us and our clients. We have 
not only provided clients with "basic" promotional products such as pens, 
mugs, wearables and mousepads but we have worked on some cutting-edge 
projects that included individually shipping live bonsai trees in imprinted 
pots, creating custom juggling toys, providing logoed remote control cars 
and using our overseas sourcing to produce custom shaped stress toys.
</p>

<p>
Our products have been mentioned in Rolling Stone Magazine, purchased by a 
U.S. president, worn by rock stars and have traveled to the bottom of the 
ocean. Just think what we can do for you! 
</p>

<p>
The canine supermodel used on our website and mousepad is not just another 
pretty face. &#8220;Bonita&#8221; became a part of New Boston Promotions in 
May of 2001. She was rescued from an inner-city dog pound in Connecticut 
only days before she was scheduled to be put down. She is an over-achieving 
Australian Cattle Dog/American Staffordshire Terrier mix. When not doing 
mousepad photo shoots other corporate duties include acting as an early 
warning device for UPS deliveries, procuring treats and power napping on 
the office floor.
