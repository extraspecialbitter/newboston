<FONT FACE="Bookman" SIZE=4 COLOR="#e0e0e0">
What are promotional products?<br><bR>

<FONT FACE="Bookman" SIZE=4 COLOR="#3d0069">
Promotional products (sometimes called advertising specialties) are products 
bearing a company logo or other message.  They are generally given away to 
customers or prospects for the purpose of generating name recognition or 
goodwill.  Examples of promotional products are imprinted pens, tee shirts, 
magnets, mugs, etc.<br><bR>

<FONT FACE="Bookman" SIZE=4 COLOR="#e0e0e0">
What is the difference between a promotional product and a premium? <br><bR>

<FONT FACE="Bookman" SIZE=4 COLOR="#3d0069">
A premium is a product that is given away as a bonus with the purchase of 
another product.  Prizes found in cereal boxes and toasters given to new 
checking account customers by banks are examples of premiums.  It is some 
times difficult to distinguish between premiums and promotional products, but 
generally a promotional product is distributed free and premiums require the 
completion of an obligation prior to receipt.<br><bR>

<FONT FACE="Bookman" SIZE=4 COLOR="#e0e0e0">
What is "camera-ready" artwork?<br><bR>

<FONT FACE="Bookman" SIZE=4 COLOR="#3d0069">
Black and white laser printed artwork of 1200 dpi or higher or a black and 
white glossy stat of your logo would be considered camera-ready art.<br><bR>

<FONT FACE="Bookman" SIZE=4 COLOR="#e0e0e0">
Do you accept electronic artwork?<br><bR>

<FONT FACE="Bookman" SIZE=4 COLOR="#3d0069">
Yes.  The general rule for most items is that art files must be created in 
Adobe Illustrator, Macromedia Freehand, or CorelDraw.  All CorelDraw (CDR) 
files must be saved as an AI file EPS (Adobe Illustrator, EPS, Curves.) All 
files must be saved as EPS and all text converted to outline. EPS format 
files provide superior reproduction quality allowing images to be resized 
with no loss of sharpness or detail.  We also require that you fax a hard 
copy of your artwork to us at the same time that you e-mail us.<br><bR>
