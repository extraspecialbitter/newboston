The canine supermodel used on our website and mousepad is not just another 
pretty face. "Bonita" became a part of New Boston Promotions in May of 2001. 
She was rescued from a dog pound in Connecticut only days before she was 
scheduled to be put down. She is a whip smart Australian Cattle Dog/American 
Staffordshire Terrier mix. When not doing mousepad photo shoots she lives to 
stick her face in the blast of water coming out of the garden hose.  (We 
don't understand it either...but it keeps her clean!)  Other corporate duties 
include acting as an early warning device for UPS deliveries, procuring 
treats and power napping on the office floor.
<p>
Bonita was voted <a href="http://www.doghousebar.com/OldDogs/Bonita.html">"Dog Of The Moment"</a> by a Boston area night club.
<p>
She even has <a href="./bonita.html">her own website!</a>
