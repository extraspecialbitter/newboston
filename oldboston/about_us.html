In 1988 New Boston Promotions began as a small promotional products distributorship.  In 1992 we formed a strategic alliance with Geiger, the largest privately held company in the promotional products industry. The combination of the two provides our clients with the flexibility, creativity and personal service of a small distributorship coupled with the competitive pricing, stability and technical know-how of an industry giant.  Every year for the past 20 years Geiger has been named a top ten distributor by the Advertising Specialty Institute.
<p>
The past 10 years have been exciting ones for New Boston/Geiger and our clients.  We have not only provided clients with "basic" promotional products such as pens, mugs, wearables and mousepads but we have worked on some cutting-edge projects that included live bonsai trees in imprinted pots, custom juggling toys, and logoed remote control cars.
<p>
Our products have been mentioned in Rolling Stone Magazine, purchased by a U.S. president, worn by rock stars and have traveled to the bottom of the ocean.  Just think what we can do for you!
