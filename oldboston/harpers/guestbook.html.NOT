<b>Just wanted to say that I posted something here earlier today asking why Clutch is always booked at Harper's with a "Jam Band" opening for them and no wonder they don't get the crowds they should be getting there lately. Very VERY few fans of Clutch Grabwell are going to be fans of any Jam Band. It's hard for us to sit through waiting for the energy of the Clutch boys. But my message was taken off. Oh well...so much for free speech. See you all there on Friday. We all can't WAIT!!!</b><br>

<b>Been around Harpers since before it was Harpers. Riley's, now there was an establishment, back then I believe the largest customer base was bikers. Not that there is anything wrong with that, it was just a bit scary for us non-bikers. So you've got the worlds best bar band, Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes, booked into Boston's best music bar on 1/17/02. Perfect combination. The only way to improve it would be if the listing read:
Headliner - Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes
Opening act - Clutch Grabwell
If Charlie is as sharp as he used to be he has already figured this out. Hey you Entrain fans out there, guess who did a little stretch as the drummer for Southside a looong time ago? Ask Tom.</b><br>

<b>So, I'm really psyched to be heading to Boston.  I'm coming up to see The Ordinary Way from Northern Va, in their second Boston gig.  They're opening up for Entrain, and well, check them out at www.theordinaryway.com, there's MP3's and info galore to tantalize your mind.  It's blues with a pinch of reggae, a dash of psychedelia, a cup of jazz, a smidgeon of funk, and groove added and mixed until smooth.  The recipe serves well over 400+ and there are thousands of satisfied consumers, so take a taste and check them out this Saturday, June 9th.  THanks,

<b>Hey Guys
This is Joe from 91.3 WDJM FM Framingham state college radio
I just wanted you to know that I am a huge fan of your club
and I have been going there for the past two years. I also
have been promoting alot of the bands that I see there. 
This year as the new station manager I thought it would be 
good to contact you and also to ask you to keep me posted 
with upcoming shows and events.  If you could put me on your 
guest list I will come as often as I can to help promote
bands that donate C.d's to the station and also to promote
your business.  This semester at WDJM I am also trying to 
acquire jackets for DJ's by seeking out donations from 
sponsers whose names will appear on the jackets
and will recieve much press from our DJ's.  If any of this 
sounds appealing then please contact me at the above 
email address.
