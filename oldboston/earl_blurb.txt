Gamelan Productions presents Ronnie Earl and the Broadcasters with Galactic
on Thursday October 16th at the Somerville Theatre (55 Davis Square,
right next to the T station) in Somerville!  Ronnie Earl was just awarded
the 1997 W.C. Handy award for best blues guitarist.  This places him in
the elite company of blues legends B.B. King, Buddy Guy and John Lee 
Hooker.  The Boston-based performer continues to build a following as
one of the most inspiring, innovative blues guitarists today.  His style
has been compared to that of Carlos Santana, Eric Clapton and Duane
Allman, but his heartfelt renderings remain uniquely his own.  Galactic
has been classified as one part natural acid jazz and two parts New
Orleans groove, falling somewhere between the Meters and Medeski, Martin
and Wood.  Tickets are $20 and $25.  Doors open at 7:30, with the show
beginning at 8:00 PM.  Plenty of free parking behind the theatre.  The
